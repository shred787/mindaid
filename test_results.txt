# TASK COMPLEXITY DETECTION - TEST RESULTS

✅ **SIMPLE TASKS** (correctly identified):
1. "Update Sarah hosting account password"
   → Scenario: simple | Priority: 2 | Time: 30min | Clients: 1

2. "Call John about his billing issue tomorrow at 2pm"  
   → Scenario: simple | Priority: 2 | Time: 60min | Clients: 1

✅ **COMPLEX PROJECTS** (correctly identified):
3. "We need to migrate all our client websites from the old server to the new hosting platform"
   → Scenario: complex | Priority: 3 | Time: 960min (16 hours) | Clients: 50
   → Business Context: "Multiple clients and systems, requiring coordination and testing"

✅ **REVENUE-CRITICAL** (correctly identified):
4. "The main server is down and affecting 50+ client websites - need immediate action"
   → Scenario: revenue_critical | Priority: 5 | Time: 120min | Clients: 50
   → Business Context: "Critical server outage affecting 50+ clients, potential revenue loss"

## DETECTION ACCURACY: 100%

The system correctly identifies:
- Task complexity levels (simple/complex/revenue_critical)
- Appropriate priority scaling (1-5, with 5 being urgent)
- Realistic time estimates (30min for simple tasks, 16+ hours for complex projects)
- Number of affected clients
- Business context reasoning

## NEXT STEPS:
- System ready for complex task breakdown (creates subtasks automatically)
- Hard accountability alerts configured for revenue-critical scenarios
- Real-time notifications through WebSocket for urgent tasks

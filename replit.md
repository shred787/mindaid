# Overview

This is a full-stack AI-powered productivity and accountability system built with React, Express, and PostgreSQL. The application is laser-focused on SHEER PRODUCTIVITY AND ACCOUNTABILITY - helping users complete tasks and subtasks with mandatory evidence collection. Every task completion requires tangible proof through screenshots, documents, PDFs, emails, call logs, or detailed descriptions. The system enforces strict accountability through evidence validation and rejects generic completion claims.
